Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles takes all of my free time for months every year. A lot of effort went
into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky and @ericwastl@hachyderm.io
on Mastodon.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 5: Cafeteria ---</h2><p>As the forklifts break through the wall, the Elves are delighted to discover that there was a cafeteria on the other side after all.</p>
<p>You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. "At this rate, we won't have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!" Resolute in your quest, you investigate.</p>
<p>"If only we hadn't switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!" another Elf exclaims. You ask what's going on.</p>
<p>The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can't figure out which of their ingredients are <em>fresh</em> and which are <span title="No, this puzzle does not take place on Gleba. Why do you ask?"><em>spoiled</em></span>. When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>The database operates on <em>ingredient IDs</em>. It consists of a list of <em>fresh ingredient ID ranges</em>, a blank line, and a list of <em>available ingredient IDs</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

1
5
8
11
17
32
</code></pre>
<p>The fresh ID ranges are <em>inclusive</em>: the range <code>3-5</code> means that ingredient IDs <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> are all <em>fresh</em>. The ranges can also <em>overlap</em>; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in <em>any</em> range.</p>
<p>The Elves are trying to determine which of the <em>available ingredient IDs</em> are <em>fresh</em>. In this example, this is done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>1</code> is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.</li>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>5</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>3-5</code>.</li>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>8</code> is spoiled.</li>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>11</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>10-14</code>.</li>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>17</code> is <em>fresh</em> because it falls into range <code>16-20</code> as well as range <code>12-18</code>.</li>
<li>Ingredient ID <code>32</code> is spoiled.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in this example, <em><code>3</code></em> of the available ingredient IDs are fresh.</p>
<p>Process the database file from the new inventory management system. <em>How many of the available ingredient IDs are fresh?</em></p>
